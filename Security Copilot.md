# 🧠 Microsoft Security Copilot in SOC Operations

## 🔍 Overview
In this phase of the **Microsoft Sentinel SOC Project**, i am using the  **Microsoft Security Copilot** to enhance incident investigation and response efficiency.  
Security Copilot combines the power of **AI-driven analysis** with **Microsoft’s threat intelligence** to help SOC analysts quickly understand alerts, summarize incidents, and recommend next steps.

---

## ⚙️ Objective
The main goal was to:
- Accelerate **incident triage** and **response**.
- Simplify **threat investigation** using Copilot’s natural language prompts.
- Generate **AI-based summaries** of incidents to support decision-making.
- Reduce manual analysis time during security operations.

---

## 🧩 Workflow Summary
1. A **security incident** was triggered within **Microsoft Defender Portal**.  
2. The incident details were passed to **Microsoft Security Copilot**.  
3. Using AI analysis, Copilot:
   - Summarized the incident automatically.
   - Highlighted **key impacted assets** and **attack vectors**.
   - Suggested **next response actions**.
4. Based on Copilot’s recommendations, kql query i was able to  validated the findings and **resolved the incident efficiently**.
