# ✉️ Microsoft Defender for Office 365 – Preset Security Policies

## 🔍 Overview
In this section of the Cloud SOC project, I explored and configured **Preset Security Policies** in **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** (MDO) to strengthen protection against phishing, spam, and malware threats within email communications.

---

## ⚙️ Purpose
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 helps secure organizational email and collaboration environments by applying advanced threat protection policies such as **Safe Links**, **Safe Attachments**, and **Anti-Phishing**.

---

## 🧱 Preset Protection Levels

| Protection Level | Description | Recommended For |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Built-in protection** | Automatically applied default protection for all users (available in paid MDO tenants). | All users by default. |
| **Standard protection** | Balanced protection profile for spam, phishing, and malware. | General user base. |
| **Strict protection** | Strongest security settings with advanced detonation and filtering. | Executives or high-value accounts. |

---

## 🧩 My Implementation
As part of this project, I:
- Enabled and validated **Standard Protection** policies.
- Tested **Strict Protection** for high-risk users.
- Observed how **Safe Links** and **Safe Attachments** prevented malicious content.
- Verified **machine learning and detonation capabilities** through simulated phishing scenarios.

## ✅ Outcome
By enabling and analyzing Standard and Strict protection levels, I was able to demonstrate how **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** enhances the email security layer in a Cloud SOC environment.  
These protections form the first line of defense against **phishing**, **malware**, and **unsafe URLs** in enterprise email systems.

**Tool:** Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO)  
**Portal:** Microsoft 365 Defender (`security.microsoft.com`)  
**Module:** Email & Collaboration → Threat Policies → Preset Security Policies
