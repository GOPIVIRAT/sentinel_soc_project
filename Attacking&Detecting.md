# üß© Attacking & Detecting ‚Äî Onboarding Phase

## üîπ Overview
Before starting the attack and detection phase, I first onboarded my machines into Microsoft Sentinel to ensure that all logs and telemetry are centrally collected for monitoring and analysis.

---

### üíª Onboarding Personal Laptop (Azure Arc) & Azure Virtual Machine
I started by onboarding my **personal Windows laptop** using **Azure Arc**, which connects non-Azure machines to the Azure environment.  
I installed the **Azure Connected Machine Agent** and linked the device to my **Log Analytics Workspace** that is already connected to Microsoft Sentinel.  
After onboarding, I verified that the machine appeared under **Azure Arc ‚Üí Connected Machines** and that logs were being sent via the **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**.  

Next, I onboarded the **Azure Virtual Machine** into the same workspace.  
I enabled **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and configured **Diagnostic Settings** to send Security Logs, Syslogs, and Performance metrics to Sentinel.  
This ensures that both the personal laptop and Azure VM are monitored in real-time for process, authentication, and network-level activities.  

‚úÖ **Result:**  
Both the personal and Azure VM machines successfully started forwarding logs to Sentinel through the Log Analytics workspace, forming the foundation for later attack simulation and detection.

### üêß Onboarding Ubuntu Machine
I also onboarded an **Ubuntu machine** to include a Linux environment for cross-platform visibility.  
I installed the **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** and configured **Syslog** and **auditd** to forward authentication and process logs to Microsoft Sentinel.  
Once configured, the Ubuntu system appeared under the **Agents Connected** list in the workspace.  
Additionally, I enabled **OSQuery** for advanced endpoint visibility and tested the integration by generating sample SSH login events.  

‚úÖ **Result:**  
Ubuntu logs such as authentication attempts, process executions, and system activities are now visible in Microsoft Sentinel, enabling Linux-based attack detection.

### üß† Verification
After completing the onboarding of all three systems:
- All devices (Laptop, Azure VM, Ubuntu) appear in Microsoft Sentinel.  
- Log data is successfully ingested into the **Log Analytics Workspace**.  
- Test queries (e.g., login events, process creation) confirmed that telemetry is flowing correctly.

---

### üöÄ Next Step
With all machines onboarded and sending telemetry, the next phase focuses on **Attack Simulation and Detection** ‚Äî performing controlled attacks like reconnaissance, brute-force, and privilege escalation to validate Sentinel detections and automation rules.
