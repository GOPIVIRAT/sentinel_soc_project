# 1. Introduction

I’m Gopi Siddamsetty, an MCA graduate specializing in Cybersecurity.
Before starting this project, I built strong practical knowledge by studying and practise the AZ-900, SC-900, and SC-200 topics through Microsoft Learn, online labs, and YouTube and my azure student subscription.
This foundation helped me confidently start this project and understand cloud security concepts in a real environment.

# 2. KQL (Kusto Query Language)

In this section, I practiced KQL extensively using real logs.
I worked with operators, filters, joins, time patterns, and grouping techniques to reduce noise and highlight suspicious activity.
This hands-on querying improved my detection logic, alert understanding, and investigation accuracy.

# 3. Microsoft Sentinel

Here, I explored Sentinel deeply through a student subscription — completely hands-on.
I navigated and tested features like Analytics Rules, Incidents, Hunting, UEBA, Workbooks, Data Connectors, and more.
This practical exploration strengthened my understanding of SIEM + SOAR workflows.

# 3.1 Security Copilot

I used Microsoft Security Copilot to summarize incidents, understand attack paths faster, and reduce investigation time.
It helped me validate alerts, extract key evidence, and improve my decision-making speed during analysis.

# 4. Attacking & Detecting

I performed 15+ real attacks on my own laptop (malware simulation, brute-force attempts, persistence, phishing tests, and more).
I collected Sysmon + Security logs in Log Analytics, wrote custom detection rules, and manually investigated each alert.
Solving every case practically helped me improve my incident investigation workflow and real-world detection skills.

# 5. Logic App Playbooks

After learning manual investigation, I created automation playbooks to reduce alert fatigue.
These playbooks automate tasks like enrichment, blocking, reputation checks, and notifying analysts.
Building them helped me understand how SOAR reduces workload and speeds up response.

# 6. Defender Services

This section covers my practical understanding of the Microsoft Defender ecosystem — including MDE, MDI, MDCA, MDO, and MDC.
I explored where each product fits, what telemetry it provides, and how it helped me correlate alerts across different security layers.

# 7. Defender for Cloud

I explored Defender for Cloud in depth — enabling plans, reviewing recommendations, analyzing secure score, and testing detections.
This hands-on work helped me understand cloud workload protection, posture management, and resource-level alerts.

# 8. Python & PowerShell Scripting

Here I practiced scripting that is useful for SOC analysts:

**PowerShell**  
I used PowerShell to:
- Inspect running processes
- Review network connections
- Export logs
- Analyze events
- Interact directly with the attacked machine  

*This improved my endpoint investigation skills.*

**Python**  
I used Python for:
- Extracting IPs from large files
- Cleaning and parsing logs
- Writing small automation helpers
- File handling tasks  

*This strengthened my SOC automation and data-processing skills.*


# 9. AI Security Analyst

My long-term goal is to become an AI-powered Security Analyst.
Here I explored how AI helps SOC teams — from detection enhancement to agent-based automation.
While learning, I built a basic understanding of LLMs, ML fundamentals, and AI-driven security workflows, which supports my future-proof career path.

# 🎯 FINAL OUTCOME

**“Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience across the entire security operations workflow in cloud— attacking, detecting, investigating, and automating.
Each section improved a specific SOC skill:

✔ KQL → Faster investigations

✔ Sentinel → Real SIEM workflow understanding

✔ Attack simulation → Better detection logic

✔ Logic Apps → Automated response

✔ Defender → Multi-layered visibility

✔ Scripts → Efficient evidence collection

✔ AI → Next-gen SOC readiness

This project prepared me to contribute effectively from day one as a Cloud SOC Analyst.”**
