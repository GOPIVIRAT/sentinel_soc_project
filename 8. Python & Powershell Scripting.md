# PowerShell Essentials for a Cloud SOC Analyst

**📌 Why PowerShell Matters in Cloud Security**
- PowerShell is one of the most commonly abused tools by attackers
- Most modern attacks involve:
  - Executing malicious scripts
  - Downloading payloads using PowerShell
  - Performing recon (network, system, users)
  - Modifying registry or system settings
- Because attackers rely heavily on PowerShell, a SOC Analyst must understand PowerShell basics to:
  - Investigate alerts
  - Analyze processes
  - Identify suspicious activity

**📘 What I Practiced**
- To build a strong foundation, I practiced the most important PowerShell commands that help in investigations:

**1. System & User Information**
- Checking system details
- Listing running processes
- Checking logged-in users
- Understanding system changes

**2. Network Investigation Commands**
- Checking active connections
- Viewing listening ports
- Identifying remote IP connections
- Testing connectivity
- Useful when investigating network-based attacks or suspicious outbound traffic

**3. File & Directory Operations**
- Listing files and hidden items
- Checking file metadata
- Viewing recently modified files
- Navigating the system quickly
- Useful for detecting suspicious scripts or recently changed files

**4. Security-Focused Commands**
- Getting Event Logs
- Checking service status
- Identifying startup programs
- Reviewing PowerShell execution history
- Helps detect persistence and malicious activity

**🎯 Why This Helps Me as a SOC Analyst**
- Quickly validate alerts without depending entirely on GUI tools
- Spot suspicious commands, scripts, and attacker behavior
- Correlate logs from Sentinel with real PowerShell activity
- Analyze processes, connections, and files more effectively
- PowerShell is not just a scripting tool — it is a core investigation skill fo
