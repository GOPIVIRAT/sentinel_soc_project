# PowerShell Essentials for a Cloud SOC Analyst
**📌 Why PowerShell Matters in Cloud Security**

PowerShell is one of the most commonly abused tools by attackers. Most modern attacks involve:

Executing malicious scripts

Downloading payloads using PowerShell

Performing recon (network, system, users)

Modifying registry or system settings

Because attackers rely heavily on PowerShell, a SOC Analyst must understand PowerShell basics to investigate alerts, analyze processes, and identify suspicious activity.

**📘 What I Practiced**

To build a strong foundation, I practiced the most important PowerShell commands that help in investigations:

**1. System & User Information**

Checking system details

Listing running processes

Checking logged-in users

Understanding system changes

**2. Network Investigation Commands**

Checking active connections

Viewing listening ports

Identifying remote IP connections

Testing connectivity

These commands are extremely useful when investigating network-based attacks or suspicious outbound traffic.

**3. File & Directory Operations**

Listing files and hidden items

Checking file metadata

Viewing recently modified files

Navigating the system quickly

Useful for detecting suspicious scripts or recently changed files.

**4. Security-Focused Commands**

Getting Event Logs

Checking service status

Identifying startup programs

Reviewing PowerShell execution history

These help detect persistence and malicious activity.

**🎯 Why This Helps Me as a SOC Analyst**

I can quickly validate alerts without depending entirely on GUI tools.

I can spot suspicious commands, scripts, and attacker behaviour.

I can correlate logs from Sentinel with real PowerShell activity.

I can analyze processes, connections, and files more effectively.

PowerShell is not just a scripting tool — it is a core investigation skill for any SOC Analyst, especially in cloud environments.
